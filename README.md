## Hi, I'm Duncan 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a Mac, Windows and Linux systems administrator working at the University of Oxford 👨🏻‍🎓.
Over the years I've written a variety of small to moderate-sized projects in a mix of languages.

C# is probably my favourite ❤️, with Java in second place 👍🏻, as I particularly like strong typing, memory
safety, platform independence and good quality unit testing frameworks. I'd be intrigued to learn

if the right systems-level project came along and if C++ couldn't handle it.

⚡ Fun fact: I have a real, slightly pointy, elven-style ear (but just the one)
