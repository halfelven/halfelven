## Hi, I'm Duncan 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a Mac, Windows and Linux systems administrator working at the University of
Oxford 👨🏻‍🎓. Over the years I've written a variety of small to moderate-sized projects in a
mix of languages.

I particularly like strongly typed, compiled, easily cross-platform languages,
especially those with well integrated unit testing frameworks, C# is probably my strongest
👍🏻. In the future I'd quite like to work on a project where I could learn

<img src=images/Java.png height="15" title="Java"> (I actually lived through the
90s and never learned Java 🤷🏻‍♂️).

⚡ Fun fact: My username isn't random. I have a real, slightly pointy, elven-style ear (but just the one)
